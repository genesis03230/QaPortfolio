# Qa Portfolio

This repository showcases my work in **Quality Assurance**, with a focus on **manual testing applied to videogame projects** and **web QA automation as a complementary skill**.

It includes:
- Manual test cases and bug reports applied to Unity videogame projects
- Visual evidence (videos and GIFs) of reported issues
- A separate QA automation framework developed in Java for web applications

## About Me
I am a QA Tester / Game Tester Junior with a background in videogame development using Unity and C#.  
I apply QA practices to my own game projects to improve quality, gameplay stability, and user experience prior to public releases and game jams.  
In parallel, I have experience building a web QA automation framework, which strengthens my technical understanding of testing principles and software behavior.
